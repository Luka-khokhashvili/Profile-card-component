Building this project was fun and challenging as well.
I improved my skills in writing better and cleaner code. I also gained a better understanding of the importance of the inspection tool and became better at using it.
At the same time, I would like to mention that I have improved even more in creating responsive design.

### Continued development

Every day I acquire and learn modern and different approaches to solving problems
